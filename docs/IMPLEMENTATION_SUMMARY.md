# GraphForge v0.2 Implementation Plan - Complete Summary

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Implementation
**Plan Mode:** Complete

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully created comprehensive implementation plan for GraphForge v0.2, including:
- **9 GitHub issues** with detailed specifications
- **2 milestones** (v0.2.0 and v0.3.0)
- **OpenCypher compatibility analysis** revealing realistic scope
- **Honest positioning** as "Core Cypher-compatible" (not "feature complete")
- **Documentation reorganization** for clarity

### Key Decision: Revised Scope

**Original claim (plan mode):**
> "v0.2 - Feature complete for full OpenCypher"

**Revised positioning (after analysis):**
> "v0.2 - Core Cypher-compatible for common graph operations"

After comprehensive OpenCypher TCK analysis, v0.2 represents **~25% TCK compliance** (950/3,837 scenarios), providing essential features for **80% of typical graph workflows** — not full OpenCypher.

## OpenCypher Compliance Analysis

### Current State (v0.1.4)

**TCK Compliance:** 638/3,837 scenarios (16.6%)

**Supported:**
- Core clauses: MATCH, WHERE, RETURN, WITH, ORDER BY, LIMIT, SKIP
- Writing: CREATE, SET, DELETE, MERGE
- Aggregations: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
- Basic functions: String manipulation, type conversion
- Data types: Primitives, lists, maps, graph elements

### Projected v0.2.0

**TCK Compliance:** ~950/3,837 scenarios (~25%)

**New capabilities:**
- UNWIND (list iteration)
- DETACH DELETE (cascading deletion)
- CASE expressions (conditional logic)
- REMOVE (property/label removal)
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- COLLECT aggregation
- String matching (STARTS WITH, ENDS WITH, CONTAINS)
- NOT operator
- MATCH-CREATE formalization

### Projected v0.3.0

**TCK Compliance:** ~1,500/3,837 scenarios (~39%)

**Planned:**
- OPTIONAL MATCH
- Variable-length patterns
- List comprehensions
- Subqueries
- UNION/UNION ALL

### Critical Missing Features

Identified through TCK analysis:

1. **OPTIONAL MATCH** (~150 scenarios) - Essential for NULL handling
2. **Variable-length patterns** (~150 scenarios) - Path queries
3. **List comprehensions** (~100 scenarios) - Functional list operations
4. **Subqueries** (~150 scenarios) - EXISTS, COUNT
5. **50+ additional functions** - String, list, mathematical
6. **Pattern predicates** (~100 scenarios) - EXISTS in WHERE
7. **UNION operations** (~30 scenarios) - Combining queries

### Out of Scope

**Not implementing:**
- ❌ Temporal types (date, datetime, duration)
- ❌ Spatial types (point, distance)
- ❌ Full-text search
- ❌ Multi-database features
- ❌ User management / security
- ❌ Distributed queries
- ❌ Stored procedures (CALL)

**Reason:** GraphForge is an embedded, SQLite-like graph tool for data science workflows, not a production graph database.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (6-8 hours)

Build momentum with simple, high-impact features:

1. **#29 - NOT operator** (1-2h)
   - Simple unary operator
   - Enables negation logic
   - Unblocks other queries

2. **#21 - DETACH DELETE** (1-2h)
   - Small change to DELETE executor
   - High user value (avoids errors)

3. **#25 - REMOVE clause** (2h)
   - Property/label removal
   - Straightforward implementation

4. **#28 - String matching** (2-3h)
   - STARTS WITH, ENDS WITH, CONTAINS
   - Very common in WHERE clauses

### Phase 2: Core Features (8-10 hours)

Essential query capabilities:

5. **#20 - UNWIND** (2-3h)
   - List iteration
   - Good first issue
   - Validates workflow

6. **#26 - Arithmetic operators** (2-3h)
   - +, -, *, /, %
   - Fundamental functionality

7. **#27 - COLLECT aggregation** (3-4h)
   - Most requested aggregation
   - Complements UNWIND

### Phase 3: Complex Features (7-9 hours)

Advanced but valuable:

8. **#23 - MATCH-CREATE** (3-4h)
   - Already works, needs tests
   - Formalization

9. **#22 - CASE expressions** (4-5h)
   - Complex but common
   - Conditional logic

### Total: 21-27 hours

**Parallel development possible** - Multiple developers can work on different issues simultaneously.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Breadth over Depth

**Decision:** Implement 9 diverse features in v0.2 instead of 5 features including 1 very complex (path expressions).

**Rationale:**
- Better user experience (more common use cases covered)
- Validates workflow with simpler features first
- Builds momentum and confidence
- Defers complex features to v0.3 when foundation is solid

### 2. Honest Positioning

**Decision:** Position as "Core Cypher-compatible" not "feature complete for full OpenCypher."

**Rationale:**
- v0.2 = ~25% TCK compliance, not full OpenCypher
- Transparent about gaps and limitations
- Sets realistic user expectations
- Builds trust in the project
- Defines clear roadmap to higher compliance (v1.0 = 70-75%)

### 3. Documentation First

**Decision:** Create comprehensive compatibility documentation before implementation.

**Rationale:**
- Clear understanding of scope before coding
- Reference for contributors
- Transparent for users evaluating GraphForge
- Prevents scope creep

### 4. Multi-Version Roadmap

**Decision:** Define v0.2, v0.3, v0.4, v1.0 roadmap upfront.

**Rationale:**
- Shows commitment to improvement
- Realistic incremental progress
- Clear prioritization of features
- Manages expectations (v1.0 in 2027, not immediately)

---

## Workflow Established

### Issue → Branch → PR → Merge

1. **Pick an issue** from v0.2.0 milestone
2. **Create branch:** `feature/{issue-number}-{slug}`
   - Example: `feature/20-unwind-clause`
3. **Implement** following checklist in issue
4. **Test** maintaining >85% coverage
5. **Update** CHANGELOG.md
6. **Create PR** with `Closes #{issue-number}`
7. **Merge** after CI passes and review
8. **Automatic:** Issue closes, milestone updates

### Best Practices

- Follow implementation checklist in each issue
- Maintain test coverage >85%
- Update CHANGELOG.md for each feature
- Reference issues in commits: `Part of #20`
- Final commit: `Fixes #20` or `Closes #20`
- Co-author: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
