## OpenCypher Analysis & Roadmap Revision

After comprehensive OpenCypher specification research, the v0.2 plan was revised:

### Key Finding

**v0.2 is NOT "feature complete for full OpenCypher"** — It represents **~25% TCK compliance**, providing essential features for 80% of typical use cases.

### Compliance Trajectory

| Version | TCK Scenarios | Percentage | Description |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| v0.1.4 | 638/3,837 | 16.6% | Current release |
| v0.2.0 | ~950/3,837 | ~25% | Core Cypher Complete |
| v0.3.0 | ~1,500/3,837 | ~39% | Advanced Patterns |
| v1.0 | ~2,800/3,837 | ~73% | Full core OpenCypher |

### Changes to Original Plan

**Moved to v0.3:**
- Issue #24 (Path expressions) - Too complex for v0.2, focus on breadth not depth

**Added to v0.2 (Quick Wins):**
- Issue #25 (REMOVE clause) - 2h, high user value
- Issue #26 (Arithmetic operators) - 2-3h, fundamental functionality
- Issue #27 (COLLECT aggregation) - 3-4h, most requested aggregation
- Issue #28 (String matching) - 2-3h, very common in queries
- Issue #29 (NOT operator) - 1-2h, essential logical operator

**Rationale:**
- Better **breadth** (more diverse features) vs. depth (complex niche features)
- Focus on **high-impact, commonly-used** features
- **Honest positioning:** "Core Cypher-compatible" not "feature complete"
- Establish **multi-version roadmap** to true OpenCypher compliance

### Documentation

- **Created `.github/ISSUE_WORKFLOW.md`** - Complete workflow guide (issue → branch → PR → merge)
- **Created `docs/reference/opencypher-compatibility.md`** - Comprehensive OpenCypher feature matrix, compliance tracking, gap analysis
- **Created `docs/development/v0.2-plan-summary.md`** - This file, implementation summary
- **Updated `README.md`:**
  - Revised roadmap with v0.2/v0.3 breakdown
  - Added Cypher Compatibility section
  - Honest TCK compliance metrics
  - Links to detailed compatibility docs

## Issue Structure

Each issue includes:

1. ✅ **Feature Description** - Clear user-facing description
2. ✅ **Use Case** - Why users need this feature
3. ✅ **Cypher Syntax** - Example queries with comments
4. ✅ **Implementation Checklist** - Step-by-step tasks with file references
5. ✅ **Files to Modify** - Exact file paths (10+ files per issue)
6. ✅ **Implementation Pattern** - Code examples and patterns
7. ✅ **Testing Strategy** - Unit and integration test scenarios
8. ✅ **Acceptance Criteria** - Must-have requirements
9. ✅ **References** - Links to openCypher spec and Neo4j docs
10. ✅ **Estimated Effort** - Time estimate

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Start with #20 (UNWIND)** - Good first issue, validates workflow
2. **Then #21 (DETACH DELETE)** - Small change, high value
3. **Then #22 (CASE expressions)** - Complex but commonly requested
4. **Then #23 (MATCH-CREATE)** - Already works, needs formalization
5. **Consider deferring #24 (Paths)** - Most complex, possibly v0.3

## Workflow: Issue → Branch → PR → Merge

### Starting Work

```bash
# Example: Starting work on UNWIND (issue #20)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/20-unwind-clause

# Work on feature...
```

### Creating a PR

```bash
git push -u origin feature/20-unwind-clause

gh pr create \
  --title "feat: implement UNWIND clause for list iteration" \
  --body "Closes #20

## Summary
[Feature summary here]

## Testing
[Test summary here]" \
  --label "enhancement,v0.2"
```

### Automatic Linking

Using `Closes #20` or `Fixes #20` in the PR description will:
- Automatically link the PR to the issue
- Close the issue when the PR is merged
- Update the milestone progress

## Revised Implementation Strategy

### Quick Wins First (6-8h)
Start with simple, high-impact features to build momentum:
1. **#29 (NOT)** → **#21 (DETACH DELETE)** → **#25 (REMOVE)** → **#28 (String matching)**

### Core Features (8-10h)
Then implement essential query capabilities:
5. **#20 (UNWIND)** → **#26 (Arithmetic)** → **#27 (COLLECT)**

### Complex Features (7-9h)
Finish with advanced but valuable features:
8. **#23 (MATCH-CREATE)** → **#22 (CASE)**

**Total: 21-27 hours for v0.2.0**

### Best Practices
- Follow implementation checklist in each issue
- Maintain test coverage >85%
- Update CHANGELOG.md for each feature
- Create PRs with `Closes #N` for automatic linking
- Track progress via milestone

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `.github/ISSUE_WORKFLOW.md` - Complete workflow documentation
- `docs/reference/opencypher-compatibility.md` - Comprehensive OpenCypher feature matrix (detailed)
- `docs/development/v0.2-plan-summary.md` - This summary file

### Modified Files
- `README.md` - Updated roadmap with v0.2/v0.3 split, added Cypher Compatibility section

### GitHub Resources
- **9 issues created (#20-#23, #25-#29)** for v0.2.0
- **1 issue (#24)** moved to v0.3.0
- **2 milestones created:** v0.2.0 (March 2026), v0.3.0 (June 2026)
- **5 labels created:** v0.2, v0.3, complex, testing, future

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All 9 v0.2 issues created with detailed specs
- ✅ Issues assigned to appropriate milestones
- ✅ Labels properly configured
- ✅ Comprehensive workflow documentation
- ✅ OpenCypher compatibility documentation (honest assessment)
- ✅ README updated with realistic scope and TCK metrics
- ✅ Each issue has implementation guidance
- ✅ Each issue has testing strategy
- ✅ Each issue has acceptance criteria
- ✅ Honest positioning: "Core Cypher-compatible" not "feature complete"
- ✅ Multi-version roadmap to true OpenCypher compliance (v1.0)

## Key Decision: Honest Positioning

**Original claim:** "v0.2 - Feature complete for full OpenCypher"
**Revised positioning:** "v0.2 - Core Cypher-compatible for common graph operations"

After OpenCypher TCK analysis, v0.2 represents ~25% compliance (950/3,837 scenarios), not "full OpenCypher." The revised plan:
- **Provides better breadth** - 9 diverse features vs. 5 (with 1 very complex)
- **Sets honest expectations** - Clear about gaps and limitations
- **Establishes roadmap** - Multi-version path to 70-75% compliance (v1.0)
- **Builds trust** - Transparent about what GraphForge is and isn't

GraphForge is **not** competing with Neo4j as a production database. It's an **embedded, SQLite-like graph query engine** for Python data science workflows — and that's a valuable, unique position.
